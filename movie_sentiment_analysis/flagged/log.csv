"Only good Star Wars since Disney has been the last couple episodes of Clone Wars, Andor and S1 Boba Fett. Everything else has been a little rough.. I feel like there's a market for more complex characters and plots.. there's a sizable fan base over the age of 20... Disney doesn't really leverage that.

In any case I was still holding on to a small sliver of hope that Dave Filoni would rise to the occasion. He's a talented director and I know he has it in him. I mean... a map chamber and secret ball the leads to admiral Thrawn?.. man that's just lazy writing. I feel like they just told chat gpt to write a Star Wars show...",Positive,,,2023-08-30 13:35:11.319848

"I'd have loved Dreamgirl 2 had it been different from Dreamgirl1. But the former gives the same kind of feeling as the latter.

The narrative goes haywire and ends up as just a mishmash of situations, too much of Nautanki and too many characters pursuing each other. There are also many unnecessary Comedy pieces!

Comedy that is well-presented - but not FORCED - & makes you laugh naturally requires special Comedy Intelligence - which, unfortunately, very few people in the world have. That is why such Comedy films are very, very RARE!

How many good comedy films can you think of in the last 40 years?",Positive,,,2023-08-30 14:18:32.114220
